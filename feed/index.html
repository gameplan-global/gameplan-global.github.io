										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gantt charts are like the hit Korean drama Squid Game&#8211;people either love it or hate it (because they don&#8217;t get it). Moreover, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263571905_Gantt_charts_revisited_A_critical_analysis_of_its_roots_and_implications_to_the_management_of_projects_today">research</a> indicates that Gantt Charts are one of the most-used planning and controlling tools in projects today.</p>
<p>According to a survey done with 750 project managers, the Gantt Chart was the fourth most-used tool (out of 70 tools and techniques) associated with project management.</p>
<p>No matter which side of the spectrum you are on, seasoned project managers understand the importance of using Gantt charts in their day-to-day work. In this guide, we will simplify the mystery of Gantt charts and learn how project managers can use <strong>Gantt scheduling software </strong>to up their project management game.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Gantt chart?</strong></p>
<p>Most people confuse a Gantt chart with a project management plan and wrongly do so. Having been developed over a hundred years ago, the Gantt chart tool has proved its resiliency over time.</p>
<p>A Gantt chart is basically a bar chart, which is used for team reporting and helps understand the kind of tasks that you need to do to complete a project successfully. It includes details about planned activities as well as dates, project progress, activity names, activity duration, activity start and finish dates, and more.</p>
<p>One of the most important distinctions between a Gantt chart and a project management plan is that a Gantt chart is useful for progress tracking and reporting; it is not useful for any project planning or organizing.</p>
<p>You should use a robust <strong>Gantt chart project management software </strong>to make the most of your Gantt chart.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Gantt Chart Project Management Software?</strong></p>
<p>A<strong> Gantt chart software </strong>is a widely used project management tool that demonstrates what needs to be done and when in an easy-to-understand visual format. Whether you want to monitor the project schedule or get insights into the interdependencies between tasks, a Gantt chart software comes in handy.</p>
<p>When using a Gantt chart, remember that one task must be completed before moving on to the next.</p>
<p><strong>When to Use a Free Online Gantt Chart Maker?</strong></p>
<p>With the basics underway, let&#8217;s address the most important question you may have: <em>&#8220;When to use a <strong>free Gantt chart maker online</strong>?&#8221;</em></p>
<p>You should use a <strong>Gantt chart maker online </strong>when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are driving a project that requires multiple people to perform a variety of tasks</li>
<li>You want an overview of the project&#8217;s key milestones, deadlines, completed tasks, and project roadmap</li>
<li>You want to drive large-scale projects with greater efficiency</li>
<li>You want important details about the project, such as project start and finish dates for each task, roles and responsibilities for each member performing the task, dependencies of tasks, resources needed for each task, the time needed for each task, and how the tasks are related to each other</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The takeaway: </strong></em><em>Think of a Gantt chart as a guiding map for your team members to follow throughout the project. </em></p>
<p><strong>360-degree Advantages of a Gantt Chart Software</strong></p>
<p>In this section, we will look at what defines as the <strong>best Gantt chart software. </strong>We will also look at the benefits of using a <strong>Gantt chart online </strong>maker&#8211;whether you use it in the form of a <strong>free Excel Gantt chart template </strong>or a full-fledged Gantt chart software.</p>
<p>A Gantt chart software is a multi-purpose tool that helps project managers to:</p>
<p><strong>Optimize the Workflow and Automate Processing</strong></p>
<p>An optimized project workflow makes teamwork more transparent, productive, and friction-free. It also makes collaboration among teams (both remote and on-site) more easy and more fun, ensuring everyone is on the same page at all times.</p>
<p>Moreover, team members can stay laser-focused on the tasks while working with greater accountability for their individual tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Accelerate and Improve the Project Management Process</strong></p>
<p>This tool allows project managers to set up their projects in no time at all, as they can track the project progress as well as status with a single glance.</p>
<p>They can also manage multiple projects at a time without any chaos or confusion impeding the project&#8217;s progress.</p>
<p><strong>Easily Navigate Between Different Tasks</strong></p>
<p>The project managers can use Gantt charts to toggle between tasks at the click of a button. Using the board view, they can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manage every little detail of the task</li>
<li>Invite key internal and external stakeholders to collaborate on a project</li>
<li>Share the project plan with others in real-time and set filters as needed</li>
<li>Attach important files and get notifications as well as leave comments, ensuring seamless teamwork</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Get a High-Level Overview of The Project Progress and Status</strong></p>
<p>Gantt charts are the doorway into how your project is faring. Whether you want to understand the timelines for each task and how every task relates to each other, or you wish to indicate how a task can get initiated only after related tasks are completed.</p>
<p>This bird&#8217;s eye view of the project activities drives informed decision-making among managers and allows them to course-correct while eliminating project hurdles.</p>
<p><strong>Allocate Resources Optimally</strong></p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/identify-factors-cause-project-failure-2442">PMI</a>, lack of resources is one of the primary reasons for project failure. This is where a Gantt chart software can help project managers to manage their resources more optimally as it illustrates task overlaps and dependencies.</p>
<p>They can also set realistic deadlines for the project and assign resources accordingly, ensuring that the right team members are working on the right tasks at all times.</p>
<p>More importantly, project managers can quickly reassign resources in instances of unpredictable issues cropping up.</p>
<p><strong>Track Key Elements Within a Project</strong></p>
<p>A Gantt chart software is essentially a robust tracking tool&#8211;from tracking tasks and constraints to monitoring the workflow and key performance indicators, it can help managers to stay on top of their projects without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a handy cheat sheet for you when making a Gantt chart. Use these expert-approved tips to elevate your project management expertise:</p>

<p><strong>Disadvantages of Using a Gantt Chart Software</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have a good understanding of the benefits of using a Gantt chart software, let&#8217;s look at its limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Gantt chart software has a learning curve, and using it for beginners can be challenging as well as time-consuming.</li>
<li>With large-scale projects and numerous tasks, sub-tasks, and activities, the Gantt chart can become convoluted and complicated to understand and lose its basic essence.</li>
<li>A Gantt chart software does not solely focus on showcasing the task &#8216;priority,&#8217; which can make it confusing for team members working on a project.</li>
<li>A Gantt chart does not throw detailed insights into task dependencies. It will not elaborate on intricate details that revolve around dependent tasks. This is why it is recommended that project managers use the (PERT) chart in sync with the Gantt chart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In Summary</strong></p>
<p>Among a sea of different <strong>project management softwares,</strong> <strong>Gantt chart softwares</strong> are extremely useful. A Gantt chart software illustrates complex project data such as tasks and activities in an easy-to-digest and visually-appealing manner. Since the tasks are displayed clearly, everyone understands the role they play in driving the project to success.</p>
<p>Needless to say, Gantt charts play an instrumental role in project planning today and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
<p>For many project managers, Gantt charts have emerged as a &#8216;shared language&#8217; that brings the team together and ensures a great track record of having delivered winning projects, time after time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Projects today no longer follow a linear path primarily because projects have become exceedingly data-rich (think: data related to labor estimates, capital costs, operational expenses, key performance metrics, task lists, cost-benefit analysis worksheets, risk profiles, and beyond).</p>
<p>The mere process of collating, analyzing, monitoring, and managing the diverse data touch-points throughout the project is emerging as a near-impossible task.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not all.</p>
<p>Projects are becoming increasingly complex and demand agile turnovers, thanks to the advent of technology and rising customer expectations. Moreover, the inability to control external factors such as environmental effects, a hike in the cost of materials, workplace accidents, and so on negatively affects project performance and, by extension, project success.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the biggest pet peeves of project managers is the inability to manage the project pace, which often leads to project failure, according to recent <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343914349_Visual_Project_Management_Tools_and_Practices_Supplier_Company_Case_Study">research</a>.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>visual project management software </strong>comes into play.</p>
<p>The importance of visuals in project management cannot be undermined. Here&#8217;s what science tells us:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/in-the-blink-of-an-eye-0116">study</a> by MIT, humans are wired to process the world better in the visual format. The study claims that the human mind can &#8220;identify images seen for as little as 13 milliseconds.&#8221;</li>
<li>Another <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/307545893_The_Role_of_Visual_Learning_in_Improving_Students'_High-Order_Thinking_Skills">study</a> claims that visual learning offers better results than traditional learning systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, even in the project management field, <strong>visual project management tools </strong>are becoming more commonplace (and understandably so).</p>
<p><strong>So, What is Visual Project Management (VPM)?</strong></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/visual-project-management-visual-elements-9862">PMI</a>, <em>&#8220;Visual project management is a new practice concept that integrates visual thinking tools and data visualization methodologies with more traditional project communication, reporting, and facilitation practices.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>In other words, <strong>visual</strong> <strong>project management, </strong>or VPM as it is commonly known, is a type of &#8216;lean&#8217; project management methodology. It empowers project managers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve project tasks and milestones efficiently and effectively within the proposed timeline</li>
<li>Gain insights into key project deliverables and boost visibility</li>
<li>Engage in visual thinking and leverage tools</li>
<li>Improve the project performance and effectiveness</li>
<li>Remove potential threats and uncertainties</li>
<li>Plan, control, and complete projects using visual techniques and tools</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The takeaway:</strong></em><em> The visual project management methodology enables project managers to leverage &#8216;visually-rich&#8217; tools to improve project awareness and understand critical project data points and key performance metrics.</em></p>
<p><strong>Top-4 Benefits of a Visual Project Planning Tool</strong></p>
<p>The biggest benefit of <strong>visual planning software </strong>is that it empowers project managers to <em>demonstrate </em>complex ideas in a simplified and easy-to-understand format using diagrams and visual boards. This invariably helps save your team&#8217;s time and allows you to utilize your resources optimally.</p>
<p>A visual project management software also showcases key work processes clearly. In simpler words, this means that everyone understands their role and responsibilities in bringing the project vision and ideas to life.</p>
<p>Here are the 360-degree advantages of using a visual project management tool:</p>
<p><strong>Increased Agility</strong></p>
<p>A strategic visual project management tool empowers project managers to save time and allows the team to understand the project progress <em>at a glance.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Biggest benefit: </strong></em><em>Say goodbye to convoluted and lengthy project briefs as well as updates. Visual project management allows the team to work with greater speed by gaining access to insights at the click of a button. Plus, the right tool can provide contextual information and offer actionable insights into the &#8216;entire story&#8217; of the project performance.</em></p>
<p><strong>Improved Convenience</strong></p>
<p>The right tool can help team members communicate effectively by eliminating the need to send lengthy and time-consuming emails or conduct endless meetings. It also helps to make the information more &#8216;actionable,&#8217; thanks to the intrinsic insights-driven approach.</p>
<p><em><strong>Biggest benefit: </strong></em><em>Project managers can utilize the &#8216;saved time&#8217; and use it for problem-solving other crippling issues that may be plaguing their projects.</em></p>
<p><strong>Better Clarity</strong></p>
<p>A visually-driven project management tool clearly demonstrates the task/project progress, empowering the team to identify the pain points and roadblocks quickly and make data-driven decisions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Biggest benefit:</strong></em><strong> </strong><em>It ensures quicker buy-in from key stakeholders and informed decision-making as everyone&#8217;s on the same page about the project status or progress.</em></p>
<p><strong>Increased Transparency</strong></p>
<p>A robust visual project management is one that can empower project managers with a bird&#8217;s eye view of the entire project. This increased transparency prevents chances of human error or misunderstandings.</p>
<p><em><strong>Biggest benefit: </strong></em><em>The tool paves the way for improved collaboration, allowing team members to communicate effectively and improve project workflow.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to recent <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263571905_Gantt_charts_revisited_A_critical_analysis_of_its_roots_and_implications_to_the_management_of_projects_today"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">research</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, Gantt Charts have the ability to </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&#8220;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">represent a specific paradigm that could enhance/limit the implementation process of a project depending on the specific situation.&#8221;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> </span></em></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In simpler words, this means that if Gantt Charts are used effectively, it can act as a predictor of project failure. Data also suggests that there is a direct relationship between project performance issues and the inappropriate use of Gantt Charts to plan and manage the implementation process. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is why using the right Gantt Chart tool is vital for project managers and organizations.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Significance of the Gantt Scheduling Software</span></strong></p>
<p>The Gantt Chart software can be considered a visual representation of tasks plotted against time. Here are its advantages:</p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Allows for Interactive Data Visualization</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gantt Charts empower project managers to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Create and visualize project schedules</span></li>

<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Measure project progress with a quick bird&#8217;s eye view</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Represent the entire project schedule</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Identify key task relationships as well as dependencies at a glance</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Drives Efficient Time Management</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A Gantt Chart, if implemented correctly, can help teams:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Save time and effort simultaneously </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Track important tasks, milestones, and deadlines as accurately as possible</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gain a 360-degree perspective of how the project is faring</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Access actionable insights into task deadlines and course-correct as needed</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Enables Project Managers to Drive Powerful Resource Allocation</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gantt Charts can be used to optimize your project&#8217;s resource allocation against the right tasks throughout the project life cycle. Basically, you can leverage resource-related data to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Prevent resource overload or burnout</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ensure balanced utilization of resources basis their capacity without negatively affecting the project outcome</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helps Improve Team Productivity</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Think of Gantt Chart as a centralized tool that acts as a single source of truth. Employees can access project details on the go and leverage improved team communication as well as collaboration. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Additionally, team members can interact seamlessly to understand the status of key project tasks and activities. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This tool can effectively store data from multiple projects and allow access to employees anytime, anywhere.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The learning:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> All in all, free online Gantt Charts are extremely effective in allowing project managers to analyze the project duration, identify the resources required, and strategize&#8211;as well as prioritize&#8211;the order in which tasks must be completed.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">By accurately displaying the start and end points of every task and the percentage of task completion, Gantt Charts pave the way for accurate and outcome-driven product development schedules.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tool also helps manage the dependencies between tasks, making it multipurpose in nature.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Why GamePlan is the Best Gantt Chart Software Available Today</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> The GamePlan Gantt Chart project management software is ideal for project managers as it allows them to complete projects on time and within the required budget.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Here are six compelling reasons why project managers must use GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt Chart maker online:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan&#8217;s Unique and Innovative Virtual Whiteboard Is Different </span></strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6595" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1-2.png" alt="" width="1000" height="562"   sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dmYRTuEXI&amp;t=1s">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan&#8217;s innovative virtual Whiteboard has the power to change your approach to project planning while delivering real bottom-line benefits to your business. In other scheduling software, project managers need to create a project schedule by typing a list of tasks into a Gantt Chart&#8211;a tedious process that is not engaging.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Consequentially, the whole process is typically rushed or, worse, skipped altogether. This leads to poor project planning, which incidentally is the most common reason for projects to run over time and over budget, according to <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/causes-project-failure-survey-engineers-4814">research</a>.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to this study, respondents claimed that the following planning-related factors led to project failure:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failure to have regular project planning meetings</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lack of constructability</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failure to set realistic goals for team members early</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Poor design review in the initial planning</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Failure to define requirements properly</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not enough time spent building the project infrastructure</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is where GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt Chart can help. The tool takes a different approach. You can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Plan your projects in a manner similar to how you brainstorm with your team in a conference room</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You won&#8217;t have to create a one-dimensional list of tasks; instead, you can use the room&#8217;s Whiteboard to dynamically map out the project using a combination of symbols, text, and arrows</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can show tasks and dependencies </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You can plan your projects by simply drawing your project workflow on the virtual Whiteboard</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan&#8217;s Powerful Scheduling Engine Is a Cut Above the Rest</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The GamePlan tool automatically generates Gantt Charts, which take into account key parameters such as resource capabilities, making it more accurate. As you make changes on the virtual Whiteboard, the scheduler automatically updates the project schedule and displays it in the form of a Gantt Chart. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This visually-driven tool shows your entire project timeline, including when all deliverables will be met and when the project will get completed:</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6596" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1-3.png" alt="" width="1000" height="562"   sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dmYRTuEXI&amp;t=1s">Image Source</a></p>
<p><strong>The Scheduler Is Resource-Leveled and Accurate to The Point</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6597" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1-4.png" alt="" width="668" height="494"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p><a href="/">Image Source</a></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another advantage of using GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt Chart tool is that the schedule is resourced-levelled. This means you&#8217;ll never have instances of:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Team members being double-booked or burned out</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Having an overly unrealistic schedule</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As you visually plan on the Whiteboard, a resource-levelled schedule is created automatically and presented on the GamePlan Gantt chart which shows if deadlines are possible. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Basically, you will be able to deliver tasks based on the availability and size of your team, so you can communicate the deliverable dates confidently.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This highly-creative and dynamic tool also empowers managers to deliver a positive user experience, allowing the team to plan their projects smarter and benefit from seamless project execution.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The GamePlan Tool Allows for Effective Communication and Collaboration</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tool allows team members to easily share the project plan in such a way that everyone understands it. Plus, the Whiteboard can be exported to an image file, and the Gantt chart can be saved in a PDF format.</span></p>
<p>Moreover, the plan can be easily shared online so that the project team can access it anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tool also:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Produces a daily agenda for everyone to follow, so the team has a clear direction of who needs to do what tasks and when they need to do them once the project is underway</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helps track key tasks by marking them as complete or by entering timesheets&#8211;an important feature&#8211;as projects often experience unforeseen delays</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ensures that the status of the project is up-to-date at all times</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helps get to the bottom of project delays and demonstrates <em>exactly</em> how the delay affects all the project deliverables</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Promotes project buy-in from the team while encouraging relevant questions from the board, investors, and clients </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In essence, the GamePlan tool empowers project managers with the tools to determine how to bring the project back on schedule by driving accurate and automatic planning scheduling and tracking.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt Chart Paves the Way for End-To-End Visual Planning</span></strong></p>
<p>One of the primary advantages of using GamePlan&#8217;s unique Whiteboard is creating a workspace for visual planning and leveraging the benefits of an efficient tool for communication.</p>
<p>Additionally, visual planning allows everyone on the team to plan effortlessly and navigate the tool without prior training.</p>
<p>The Whiteboard helps communicate the agenda to the team, the board, the investors, and the clients. Clear communication lays the foundation for better understanding and ensures everyone is on the same page throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt Chart Sets the Benchmark for Accurate Project Costing</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Managing cash flow is every business&#8217; raging priority. In other words, it is critical to predict costs accurately and stick to the budget. The tool allows you to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Calculate precisely how much projects will cost to help plan budgets</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Create cost schedules that demonstrate when you will incur expenses</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understand how unpredictable changes can affect a project and, by extension, the project cost</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Gantt Charts hold a special place in the field of<strong> project management software</strong>. Whether you use a <strong>free Excel Gantt Chart template </strong>or a <strong>free Gantt Chart maker online, </strong>your project stands to gain on multiple accounts. This includes improved productivity, better time and resource allocation, etc.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329099194_Effect_of_project_complexity_on_cost_and_schedule_performance_in_transportation_projects"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">data</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, in order to achieve project success, project managers need to evaluate project complexity accurately and allocate the necessary resources optimally. Any misstep or miscalculation and the project can derail. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is where a visual project management software such as GamePlan can help organizations navigate the complex project scheduling-costing matrix.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How GamePlan Helps Organizations Stay on Schedule and Within Budget</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan is a visual project management tool that empowers businesses to complete their projects on time and within budget. Here&#8217;s what makes this visual project planning tool different from its competitors:</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#Problem Area 1: Unrealistic Project Schedules</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to the <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/project-management-problems-anticipating-conflict-5769">Project Management Institute</a>, poor scheduling is one of the major reasons why projects fail. As the schedule slips, it also leads to cost overruns, missed milestones, and inaccurate performance measurements. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Some of the most important reasons for poor project scheduling include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Intense competition, which may lead to project managers proposing unrealistic schedules to give the company an &#8216;edge&#8217;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Absence of a penalty for poor schedule performance </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Constant and last-minute changes to project requirements, which may lead to adverse effects on the project schedule</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lack of experience in project planning</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lack of a database of schedule and cost performance, which can lead to inaccurate project schedule estimates</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Minimal and/or insufficient time spent on developing schedules</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not taking into account the relevant factors that influence the realism of project schedules</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How GamePlan can Solve It</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">First things first, it is important to understand that GamePlan enables behavioral and managerial change in project management. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This visual project management tool offers a unique and innovative virtual whiteboard that allows project managers to plan &#8216;smarter&#8217; and extract real bottom-line benefits for the organization. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Here&#8217;s how this tool works:</span></p>
<table width="100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Traditional Scheduling Software </strong></td>
<td><strong>GamePlan&#8217;s Visual Planning Software</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In other scheduling software, you need to create a project schedule by typing a list of tasks into a chart&#8211;a tedious process.</p>
<p>As a result, project managers may not be engaged enough and may rush, or worse, skip, the project scheduling process altogether. This is an ineffective way to plan a project and leads to poor planning, which leads to projects running over time (and over budget).</td>
<td>GamePlan takes a different approach where you can plan projects by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brainstorming with <span data-preserver-spaces="true">the </span>team in a conference room and creating a multi-dimensional list of tasks</li>
<li>Using the room&#8217;s whiteboard to dynamically map out the project and leveraging a combination of symbols, text, and arrows to show tasks and dependencies</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>All you need to do is:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Plan your projects by simply drawing your project workflow on the virtual Whiteboard:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6591" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-1-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="562"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dmYRTuEXI">Image Source</a></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Step 2:</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> GamePlan&#8217;s powerful scheduling engine &#8216;takes over.&#8217; Any change that is done on the Whiteboard is taken into account by the tool&#8217;s Scheduler.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Step 3</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: This Scheduler automatically updates the project schedule and displays it in the form of an easy-to-comprehend Gantt chart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#Problem Area 2: Inaccurate Resource Allocation</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">According to a <a href="https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/forging-future-focused-culture-11908">survey </a>done by PMI in 2020, an average of 11.4% of investment is wasted due to poor project performance. And one of the biggest drivers of poor project planning is inaccurate resource allocation. Here are some of the challenges of resource allocation and management:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Absence of data relating to resource availability in real-time</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Overburdened resources as a result of working on concurrent projects, leading to burnout</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How GamePlan can Solve It</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt chart software shows users the entire project timeline, including when all the deliverables need to be met and when the project will be completed. The schedule is resourced-leveled, which means that no one is ever double-booked.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Due to this, the schedule deadlines are achievable and realistic, providing project managers with greater confidence to publish their deliverable dates. </span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tool also:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Produces a daily agenda for everyone to follow, so the team gets a clear direction of who needs to do what tasks and when they need to do them</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helps track the project, preventing unforeseen delays in tracking</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Allows managers to mark tasks as completed or enter timesheets, ensuring that your project status is always up-to-date&#8211;even when there is a delay in the project</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Shows project managers exactly how the delay affects the overall project deliverables and it the team the required tools to determine how best to bring the project back on schedule</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Provides unparalleled project planning, scheduling, and tracking features </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Delivers true resource-level project scheduling via a visual whiteboard user experience, keeping projects on time and within budget </span></li>
</ul>
<p>GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt Chart maker online allows for accurate project planning, taking into account resource availability as the demands evolve in real-time. This creative and dynamic tool helps lend a positive user experience, allowing managers to plan their projects smarter and execute them better.</p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#Problem Area 3: Underestimated Costs or Inadequate Cost Control</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inaccurate costing is another big culprit of project failure. Your project costs may be inaccurate assumptions due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Underestimating the project cost constantly</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Factoring in ill-defined factors or obsolete procedures</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Consistent delays in estimating</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lack of robust data</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Changes to contract post contractor selection</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Incorrect cost allocation </span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inaccurate comparison of proposed estimates and budgets with actual costs</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Addition of unrelatable cost elements within the cost proposal</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How GamePlan can Solve It</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan allows project managers to estimate costs properly and control them every step of the way<strong>. </strong>It will enable businesses to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Manage cash flow</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Forecast costs correctly and stay on budget</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Calculates precisely how much projects will cost so that you can create accurate budgets</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Create cost schedules that show when expenses will be incurred</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Understand any change to a project inadvertently affects the project cost in real-time</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#Problem Area 4: Unclear Project Communication </span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The absence of clear communication can lead to numerous problems such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Inaccurate scheduling, estimating, and resource allocation</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Incomplete and inaccurate understanding of the project objectives, design, and implementation</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lack of focus on definite work statements</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Project or profit orientation of resources that is weak</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Lack of a strict approach to fundamentals of management </span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How GamePlan can Solve It</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For projects to succeed, communication is key. Whether you want to communicate business plans internally with your team or externally to the board, investors, and clients; the GamePlan tool lays the foundation for effective collaboration and communication by:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Letting everyone understand the project plan easily, presented in an easy-to-digest visual Whiteboard</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Ensuring that the project plan gets buy-in from everyone on the team</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Encouraging relevant questions from the board</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Giving clients and investors greater confidence in the company</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">#Problem Area 5: Improper Project Tracking</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Businesses continuously face unpredictable variables, which can cause unknown delays. This prevents project managers from getting a single source of truth relating to project progress and status.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In simpler words, project tracking becomes difficult due to inaccurate data being fed into the system.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How GamePlan can Solve It</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">GamePlan immediately shows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How project delays affect your deliverable dates</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How to easily test changes to your plan if the due date cannot slide</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">How you can add or reduce scope automatically</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Finally, GamePlan arms teams with the right information they need to bring the deliverable dates back on time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Takeaway</span></strong></p>
<p>GamePlan is a Gantt Chart project management software that automatically adjusts the project schedule and cost basis of the team capability. Depending on the inputs provided by the project manager, the project schedule and cost might change.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Instead of manually estimating timelines and costing like in other tools, GamePlan&#8217;s automated Scheduler does the grunt work for you and automatically estimates the project schedule and costs. </span></p>
<p>If you want to access a Gantt Chart online software that drives effective communication and enables you to keep your projects on track, GamePlan is a great tool to get started.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To wrap up, here are its 360-degree benefits:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Makes visual planning easy and eliminates mistakes</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The automatic project scheduling feature allows teams to understand when deliverables will be achieved realistically</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Project costing shows the true cost of the project minus any gaps or inaccuracies</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">An end-to-end visual communication plan ensures everyone understands the plan and is on the same page at all times</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Provides clear directions, keeping varying projects on time</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Helps track projects and keeps the schedule up to date</span></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The importance of staying on top of things cannot be stressed enough in project management. One missed deadline and the entire project can go off track.</p>
<p>This is where <strong>Gantt scheduling software </strong>becomes an extremely important tool for project managers. It allows them to juggle between people, tasks, and projects.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Gantt Chart?</strong></p>
<p>In <strong>project management software, Gantt charts </strong>come in handy for visually presenting a project schedule to understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is assigned to a particular task</li>
<li>The task duration</li>
<li>When a task is completed</li>
<li>The overlapping activities and interconnected tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of a Gantt chart as demonstrating key tasks that are plotted against the &#8216;time&#8217; component.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance of Gantt Charts</strong></p>
<p>Whether you use a <strong>free Gantt chart maker online </strong>or <strong>Gantt chart software, </strong>this tool is beneficial in understanding the key activities as well as the progress of a project.</p>

<p><strong>GamePlan: The Best Gantt Chart Software Out There</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6585" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/GAMPELAN.png" alt="" width="668" height="286"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p><a href="/">Image Source</a></p>
<p><a href="/">GamePlan</a> is a multi-purpose, visually-driven planning, scheduling, costing, tracking, and communication tool that helps organizations to complete projects on time and within the stipulated budget.</p>
<p><strong>So, What Makes Game Plan Different from the Rest of the Gantt Chart Tools</strong>?</p>
<p>Glad you asked. Here are five features that this tool offers which make it a cut above the rest:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong> Get easy buy-in from everyone</strong>: GamePlan visually communicates critical project information in a way that everyone understands it inside out. This means that it gets increasingly easier to get buy-in from all stakeholders, especially since the plan is well understood by <em>everyone.</em></li>
<li><strong> Learn and improve on the go</strong>: The tool empowers project managers to have a permanent record of the plan and the actuals at their fingertips. This means you extract actionable insights into what&#8217;s working for the project and what&#8217;s not so that you can make data-powered improvements the next time.</li>
<li><strong> Leverage its innovative virtual whiteboard: </strong>Generally speaking, in any type of scheduling software, you need to create a project schedule by typing a list of tasks into a Gantt chart &#8211; a tedious process by any stretch of the imagination. GamePlan takes a different approach. You can plan your projects as if you were brainstorming with your team in a conference room. In other words, you don&#8217;t need to create a one-dimensional list of tasks. Instead, you can use the whiteboard to dynamically map out the project using a combination of symbols, text, and arrows to show tasks and dependencies. All in all, simply plan your projects by drawing your project workflow on the virtual whiteboard:</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dmYRTuEXI">Image Source</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Take advantage of its powerful scheduling engine:</strong> Once you&#8217;ve drawn out the project plan, GamePlan&#8217;s intuitive scheduling engine takes over. If you make a change on the whiteboard, the tool&#8217;s scheduler automatically updates the project schedule and displays it in a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart also shows your entire project timeline, including when all deliverables will be met and when the project will get completed:</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6587" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Picture-2.png" alt="" width="1000" height="562"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dmYRTuEXI">Image Source</a></p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong> Use the innovative schedule feature, which is resource-leveled: </strong>GamePlan&#8217;s schedule feature is resource-leveled. This means that no one will ever be double-booked on your project. Plus, the schedule becomes realistic and achievable so that you can publish your deliverable dates with increased confidence. GamePlan&#8217;s Gantt chart is creative and dynamic and delivers a positive user experience, paving the way for improved project planning and execution.</li>
</ol>
<p><em><strong>The learning</strong></em><em>: The GamePlan visual project planning and scheduling software produces a daily agenda for everyone to follow so that your team gets clear directions on who needs to do what tasks and when they need to do them once your project is underway. This is an important element to track in any project as there will always be unforeseen delays. This ensures that your project status is always up-to-date and also shows you exactly how the delay affects the project deliverables. Finally, it gives you the tools to determine how best to bring the project back on schedule, making it a win-win for all.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></p>
<p>At its most basic form, a<strong> free online Gantt </strong>Chart can be thought of as a project timetable &#8211; one that represents how a project will progress during a project lifecycle.</p>
<p>GamePlan is a powerful and innovative visual tool that automatically generates Gantt charts, taking into account resource capabilities. This makes it more accurate.</p>
<p>In simpler words, project managers can benefit from this type of tool as it breaks down key tasks into smaller, more easy-to-digest chunks and represents them on a visual timeline. Try <strong>Gantt chart software </strong>for yourself and see the difference.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An<em> efficient</em> project manager has long been regarded as a mystical being. With managers having to don many hats &#8211; from being a leader and a strategic thinker to a problem-solver and a relationship builder &#8211; managing projects is becoming a mammoth task. And the price of poor project management is too big to pay.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the data tells us:</p>
<ul>
<li>As per data, organizations end up <strong>wasting <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf">12%</a> of their resources</strong> due to ineffective project management.</li>
<li>Research also suggests that organizations that fail to integrate project management into their strategies will witness a rise in their <strong>project failure rate</strong> by <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf?v=2a5fedd3-671a-44e1-9582-c31001b37b61&amp;sc_lang_temp=en">a factor of 2/3</a>.</li>
<li>Finally, only <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf?v=2a5fedd3-671a-44e1-9582-c31001b37b61&amp;sc_lang_temp=en">46%</a> of organizations are making project management a <strong>cultural priority</strong>—a big mistake. There&#8217;s <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf?v=2a5fedd3-671a-44e1-9582-c31001b37b61&amp;sc_lang_temp=en">statistical proof</a> that claims that a mature project management process can empower organizations to deliver on time and under budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, project managers need to think on their feet and be armed with a healthy mix of soft skills as well as technical skills to tackle the everyday challenges head-on.</p>
<p><strong>8 Must-Have Qualities of an Efficient Project Manager</strong></p>
<p>Project managers actually manage people more than they manage projects. This is why they need to have the necessary soft skills in addition to having technical experience.</p>
<p>Defining what makes a project manager efficient is a tough ask. However, there are certain qualities that every seasoned project manager exhibits.</p>
<p>These include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robust communication skills</strong>: A good project manager is first a good communicator. They should be able to clearly communicate about:</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8211; Project goals</p>
<p>&#8211; Each individual&#8217;s tasks</p>
<p>&#8211; Each team member&#8217;s roles and responsibilities</p>
<p>&#8211; Stakeholder expectations</p>
<p>&#8211; Feedback</p>
<p>In addition to this, they should be able to problem-solve effectively, demonstrate flexibility as well as adaptability, and drive interpersonal skills.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strong leadership skills</strong>: Agile project managers should be able to motivate the team and drive optimal performance so that the team can collectively achieve the outlined goals. The end goal should be to bring out the best performance from all team members.</li>
<li><strong>Sound decision-making skills</strong>: A project can fall through the cracks without good and timely decision-making skills.</li>
<li><strong>Technical expertise and know-how</strong>: Today, project managers need to not only launch products but also own the responsibility of maintaining internal processes. In fact, <a href="https://www.axelos.com/getmedia/9bd107ec-ab67-40d2-b632-f962881cc137/AXELOS-PPM-Benchmarking-Report-2019.aspx">4 out of 5</a> project managers claim that they need project portfolio management to ensure project success. Without a solid understanding of the ins and outs of project management software, a project manager is at a decided disadvantage.</li>
<li><strong>Team-building skills</strong>: A project manager is a team player. They should be fair in their treatment of other members. More importantly, they should be able to empower the team to work as a cohesive unit and play to the team&#8217;s natural talents.</li>
<li><strong>Patience and calm under pressure</strong>: As the project gains momentum and the team starts facing challenges, it is essential for the project manager to not crumble under pressure or lose their temper as well as patience.</li>
<li><strong>Negotiation skills:</strong> Considering that a project manager handles multiple stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, they should be able to negotiate effectively and fairly in a conflicting situation.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy</strong>: A project manager must be empathetic towards the team. They should be able to understand the needs of their team as well as of the project and efficiently juggle between the two. Plus, they must have a good understanding of every individual&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses and chalk out a customized project plan accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>The learning:</strong></em><em> A project manager is constantly planning, organizing, and managing projects from start to finish. They are solely responsible for ensuring that the project gets completed on time, within the stipulated budget, and to everyone&#8217;s satisfaction. All in all, a results-oriented and high-performing project manager is one who has the requisite soft skills, technical expertise, and relevant experience. </em></p>
<p><strong>Time-Tested Tools Every Project Manager Needs</strong></p>
<p>Project managers need the help of <strong>visual project management software </strong>to deliver results on time and with the least friction (or effort).</p>
<p>Without the right <strong>visual project management tool</strong> in their arsenal, this can become a challenging task. However, amazingly, only <a href="https://wellingtone.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-State-of-Project-Management-Report-2020-Wellingtone.pdf">1 in 4 </a>organizations use project management software in any capacity, despite its proven benefits.</p>
<p>In this section, we will look at some of the best <strong>visual project planning tools </strong>every project manager needs.</p>
<p><strong>Top 3 Visual Project Management Tools Worth Considering</strong></p>
<p>Visual<strong> planning software </strong>is worth the investment &#8211; be it monetary or otherwise. It empowers project managers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a bird&#8217;s eye view of the team&#8217;s progress</li>
<li>Zoom in to see each individual&#8217;s work</li>
<li>Manage the team&#8217;s workload with live, up-to-date data on the resources available</li>
<li>Drive smarter decisions on how to utilize team members</li>
</ul>
<p>The right kind of visual project management tool can play an instrumental role in setting up project managers for delivering winning projects.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/"><strong>GamePlan</strong></a>:</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6578" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gameplan.png" alt="" width="668" height="288"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p><a href="/">Image Source</a></p>
<p>GamePlan is an all-in-one visual planning software that allows project managers to engage in planning, scheduling, costing, tracking, and communicating to deliver projects on time and within the budget. Here&#8217;s what makes it different:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Easier to get buy-in from everyone</strong>: GamePlan as a tool is deceptively simple to understand. Its innovative virtual whiteboard effectively communicates critical details of a project in a way that everyone understands and delivers real bottom-line benefits to your business. As a result, it is easier to get buy-in when the plan is well understood:</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6579" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gameplan-2.png" alt="" width="1000" height="562"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6dmYRTuEXI&amp;t=1s">Image Source</a></p>
<p>In other scheduling software, you have to create a project schedule by typing a list of tasks into a <strong>Gantt chart maker online</strong>, which is a tedious process.</p>
<p>GamePlan takes a different approach. You can plan your projects as if you were brainstorming with your team in a conference room. You wouldn&#8217;t need to create a one-dimensional list of tasks. Instead, you can use the room&#8217;s whiteboard to dynamically map out the project using a combination of symbols, text, and arrows to show tasks and dependencies.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ability to learn and improve</strong>: You can access a permanent record of the plan and the actuals. This shows you what went well and where you can improve next time.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic updates: </strong>The scheduler automatically updates the project schedule and displays it in a Gantt chart. The Gantt chart shows your entire project timeline, including when all deliverables will be met and when the project will get completed. The schedule is resource-leveled, which means that no one is ever double-booked, and the schedule is achievable. This allows project managers to publish the deliverable dates with confidence because of accurate and efficient project planning.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong> <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=105703213648&amp;campaign=9843285520&amp;creative=437184392296&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p53016482436&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8OmZg66Y-QIV3pVLBR0DgwZBEAAYASAAEgL0RfD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Trello</a>:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Trello is a simple visual task management tool that allows you to organize tasks on a Kanban board. This tool helps you to visualize your project schedule on a timeline, calendar, and map.</p>
<p>Trello leverages board, lists, and cards, allowing project managers to start a Trello board in seconds. They can view board data from many different angles, allowing the entire team to stay up-to-date in the way that suits them best. Users can use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Timeline view for project planning</li>
<li>Calendar, which helps them with time management</li>
<li>The Table view to connect work across boards</li>
<li>Board stats with the Dashboard</li>
</ul>
<p>The lists and cards empower the team to grow with task assignments, timelines, productivity metrics, calendars, and beyond. All in all, project managers can manage projects, organize tasks, and build team spirit &#8211; all in one place.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6580" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Trello.png" alt="" width="668" height="448"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p>Moreover, think of the Trello cards as a centralized portal for more organized work &#8211; where every single part of the task can be managed, tracked, and shared with teammates. Project managers can open any card to uncover an ecosystem of checklists, due dates, attachments, conversations, and more.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong> <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/task-management-software">Microsoft Planner</a>:</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Microsoft Planner is a <strong>Gantt chart project management software. </strong>It can be thought of as a visual Kanban tool that paves the way for increased team collaboration and visual task management. It comes included with the Microsoft Office 365 subscription, making it easier to access. Its top two features include the use of Kanban task boards and a Charts dashboard view.</p>
<p>The Planner feature allows you to design and structure all tasks visually:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6581" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Planner.jpg" alt="" width="668" height="386"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theprojectgroup.com/en/office-365-microsoft-planner">Image Source</a></p>
<p>These tasks are displayed in theme-related sections, also known as &#8220;buckets&#8221; or columns. Project managers can name these buckets individually as needed. With this tool, project managers can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a plan, compile a team, assign tasks, and update the status of the associated tasks.</li>
<li>Leverage agile work methods using the Kanban board on which tasks can be moved using drag and drop.</li>
<li>Use it to get visibility into the team&#8217;s progress as well as into individual representation of tasks assigned to one person.</li>
</ul>
<p>There you go. An efficient project manager is one who can effectively traverse between using a <strong>Gantt chart software</strong> for the project&#8217;s benefit, demonstrating the right soft and technical skills, and driving powerful project management with a heady mix of intuition and innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looking for a visual project planning tool that&#8217;s better than Microsoft Project? We&#8217;ve got you covered. In this handy guide, we will look at the best, expert-approved visual project management tools you can try to give your project a boost.</p>
<p>Before we look at the visual planning software, let&#8217;s understand the importance of a visual project planning tool. Here&#8217;s what the data tells us:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ineffective project management</strong>: According to estimates, organizations waste <a href="https://www.pmi.org/-/media/pmi/documents/public/pdf/learning/thought-leadership/pulse/pmi-pulse-2020-final.pdf">12%</a> of their resources due to ineffective project management. Visual workflow tools such as Gantt chart software can enable project managers to visualize their project schedule and resources more optimally.</li>
<li><strong>Low adoption, poor project management:</strong> Data also suggests that only 25% of organizations (<a href="https://www.proofhub.com/articles/project-management-statistics">1-in-4</a>) use project management software&#8211;a big mistake. Using isolated spreadsheets, paper, or separate tools leads to a disjointed project management experience.</li>
<li><strong>Opportunity for driving efficiency: </strong><a href="https://monday.com/blog/productivity/monday-com-report-state-workplace-automation/">A survey from Monday.com</a> indicates that for 54% of the participants, using tools to automate tasks will allow them to be more productive and efficient at work as it can help them to save more than 5 hours at work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The learning:</strong> Research by <a href="https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/au/pdf/2020/aipm-australian-project-delivery-performance-survey-2020.pdf">KPMG</a> found that for 58% of respondents, Covid-19 has had a mild or major impact on their projects. The need for visual project management software is now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>Top-6 Visual Project Management Tools Worth Giving a Shot</strong></p>
<p><a href="/"><strong>GamePlan</strong></a><strong>: </strong>The All-in-One Project Planning Tool that Allows for Seamless Planning, Scheduling, Costing, Tracking, and Communication</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6565" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Picture-1.png" alt="" width="668" height="264"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 668px) 100vw, 668px" /></p>
<p><a href="/">Image Source</a></p>
<p>GamePlan is a visual project management software that allows businesses to elevate their project planning game.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why GamePlan is a cut above the Microsoft Project tool:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual drawing + automatic updates</strong>: One of the reasons why GamePlan is different from all other visual planning software out there is that it allows you to plan by <em>drawing</em> the project workflow on the Whiteboard. As you plan your project, the project schedule <em>automatically</em> updates in the Gantt chart, a feature not found in many visual project management tools. The automatically-generated Gantt Charts keep the projects on track and offer team leaders an excellent method of communication. That&#8217;s not all. The software shows what is achievable. These insights are where GamePlan excels: It factors in complex schedules and available resources to accurately demonstrate what kind of deadlines can or cannot be met.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to use + better customer support:</strong> In comparison to MS Projects, GamePlan offers better customer support at all stages of the project lifecycle. Additionally, it is easier to use as the software is logically built. The software is intuitive to use, allowing project managers to draw out the complex contents of the project management within their heads onto a whiteboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>According to users, it is one of the most natural ways to build programs as the sequencing is done graphically by linking activities with arrows.</p>
<p>Additionally, the graphical approach works brilliantly on the big screen, particularly during meetings. The information presented is clear and intuitive so that everyone can understand and input their knowledge and experience.</p>

<p><a href="https://miro.com/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=S%7CGOO%7CBRN%7CTier2%7CEN-EN%7CBrand%7CExact&amp;utm_adgroup=&amp;utm_custom=10031645163&amp;utm_content=605166468938&amp;utm_term=miro&amp;device=c&amp;location=1007828&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxNDfhrfp-AIVD5lmAh1I_QSxEAAYASAAEgLpKfD_BwE"><strong>Image Source</strong></a></p>
<p>Miro is an online collaborative whiteboard platform that enables project managers to work effectively, especially if the team is working remotely. Whether it&#8217;s about brainstorming ideas with digital sticky notes or planning and managing agile workflows, Miro doubles up as an effective collaborative whiteboard platform.</p>
<p>Here are a few other areas where Miro trumps Microsoft Project:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customer support</strong>: Miro offers various forms of customer support&#8211;from live chat options and FAQs to knowledge base and video tutorials, which MS Projects does not.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time collaboration for remote teams: </strong>Miro allows seamless real-time communication using good visual tools. You can discuss projects and ideas in board chats, use voice and video calls, and leave tagged comments.</li>
<li><strong>Zero learning curve</strong>: Miro is relatively simpler to use as it is a whiteboard. You can easily integrate this whiteboard into existing workflows and onboard new team members.</li>
<li><strong>All data at one place: </strong>You can workwith tools of all kinds and formats such as images, texts, videos, wireframes, docs, post-it notes, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Simple way to organize your creative workflow: </strong>Think of Miro as a must-have tool for teams that work wit creative concepts and design thinking.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.planview.com/"><strong>Planview</strong></a><strong>: A Unified Tool to Manage Everything about Projects</strong></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6567" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Planview.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="630"   sizes="auto, (max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gantt charts are every project manager&#8217;s best friend (and understandably so). The term is often thrown around a lot at project kickoff meetings or when there&#8217;s talk of boosting productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Gantt charts empower project managers to visualize time and resources within a project as simply and comprehensively as possible. All you need to do is, factor in the task duration and dependencies (if any), and voila, you&#8217;ve got a Gantt chart at hand.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Gantt chart?</strong></p>
<p>Gantt chart is named after Henry Gantt, who popularized its use in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>Visually, a Gantt chart is represented with horizontal bars. The chart illustrates a project&#8217;s timeline and dates, task owner, project schedule, upcoming milestones, and associated tasks/events during the project lifecycle.</p>
<p>Each bar represents a task, and the length of the bar represents the time it will take to complete said task. In essence, a bird&#8217;s eye view of the chart will offer important at-a-glance insights into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What work needs to be done</strong>, including the project tasks and events</li>
<li><strong>Who needs to be doing it</strong>, and how does each member&#8217;s work impacts the overall project progress</li>
<li><strong>When it needs to be done,</strong> including the start and end dates of the project</li>
<li><strong>How the project tasks connect as well as overlap with each other </strong>and how they should be grouped</li>
<li><strong>What important milestones and deadlines </strong>are around the corner</li>
<li><strong>The percentage completed</strong> <strong>for each activity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Gantt charts use &#8216;critical paths&#8217; &#8211; a methodology that helps mitigate risks and scenarios where individual tasks could cause unforeseen delays in the subsequent tasks, ultimately derailing the whole project. As the name suggests, the &#8216;critical&#8217; path allows you to understand which tasks to undertake first to be able to complete the entire project on time and successfully.</p>
<p><strong>So What Is a Gantt Scheduling Software?</strong></p>
<p>Originally, Gantt charts were drawn by hand on a piece of paper. This meant that every time there was a change in the plan, it needed to be redrawn &#8211; a huge inconvenience.</p>
<p>Today, project managers can make a Gantt chart online using Gantt chart software. Also known as a project management software, the Gantt chart was built to automate the project planning process.</p>
<p>The software also supports more advanced features such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating task dependencies such as start-to-start, finish-to-start, finish-to-finish, and start-to-finish</li>
<li>Adding milestones and project phases</li>
<li>Identifying the critical path of a project plan</li>
<li>Creating a work breakdown structure</li>
<li>Assign tasks to the team and track project progress in real-time</li>
<li>Dragging and dropping timelines to update your project schedule instantly</li>
</ul>
<p>These features enabled project managers to save valuable time and effort. Additionally, there are free online Gantt charts that project managers can leverage online and share with peers to drive a more collaborative project management process.</p>
<p>Project managers can use project management tools that are equipped with a Gantt chart maker online feature. Note that the project management tool should support the format offered by the free Gantt chart maker online for it to work.</p>
<p>You can also use a free Excel Gantt chart template (as Microsoft Excel itself doesn&#8217;t allow you to make Gantt charts) instead of a project management tool.</p>
<p><strong>Top-7 Benefits of Gantt Chart Project Management Software</strong></p>
<p>A Gantt chart software offers multiple benefits to users and organizations at large:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows you to map tasks (and, by extension, projects) in a hierarchical and incremental fashion, create accurate timelines, and keep the deliverables on track.</li>
<li>It helps you to track the project schedule and engage in an informed project planning process.</li>
<li>It allows you to create dynamic online Gantt charts collaboratively with your team. This includes key tasks such as creating timelines, dependencies, etc., and adding milestones. You can also track costs and keep tabs on the budget. The best part? As the project progresses, the Gantt chart will automatically get updated.</li>
<li>If you have too many task dependencies, using a Gantt chart can help you understand which tasks to undertake and in which order.</li>
<li>It allows you to prioritize important tasks and focus on what truly matters.</li>
<li>It enables you to monitor project progress and stay on top of your deliveries.</li>
<li>It helps make the project easier to digest as the tasks are broken down into smaller, more realistic, and achievable chunks so Gantt charts are the way to go if you need to build and manage complex projects.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Six Characteristics of the Best Gantt Chart Software Out There</strong></p>
<p>Your Gantt chart software should have the following six features allowing for seamless project planning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milestones</strong>: It should allow you to represent the project milestones, which basically mark the end of a task series or a project phase.</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies</strong>: It should throw light on the task dependencies, which demonstrate which tasks are linked together and these &#8216;links&#8217; are shown by lines, and the arrows indicate which tasks are to be done next.</li>
<li><strong>Task summary:</strong> It should provide a summary of the tasks so you can group them together as part of a project phase; it should also give a glimpse of the task progress to ensure everyone is on the same page.</li>
<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: It should allow project managers to collaborate with the team online and in real-time, or else your Gantt chart becomes static in nature. It should provide chat and comment features and should help keep the workflow documented from start to finish. Finally, it should provide instant alerts and notifications every time a task is updated or completed so that everyone is in the know.</li>
<li><strong>File-sharing</strong>: It should provide useful file-sharing capabilities, which include sharing images, documents, videos, notes, and so on at the click of a button. This feature allows the Gantt chart tool to double up as a centralized place for all things project-related, empowering project managers to keep all the task and project information together.</li>
<li><strong>Actual vs. planned progress</strong>: It should provide details on the actual versus planned progress. This feature makes an online Gantt chart software better than static charts. All project managers need to do is set a baseline at the start of the project to get invaluable insights into how the project is progressing versus how it should progress. If you want an optimized tracking experience, this last feature is essential.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How Do You Create a Gantt Chart with A Software?</strong></p>
<p>Now that we have covered the basics of Gantt chart software, let&#8217;s understand the steps to create a Gantt chart online:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by making a list of the tasks you need to be able to finish the project.</li>
<li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Next, you&#8217;ll need to define the first and last dates for every task. Make sure to consult your team for this step. Also, factor in additional follow-up tasks you may need to drive past the end date.</li>
<li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then, you&#8217;ll need to<strong> </strong>create a timeline for the project based on the task duration.</li>
<li><strong>Step 4: </strong>In this step, you&#8217;ll need to identify the task dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Step 5: </strong>This step requires you to fill out the bar chart timeline with tasks.</li>
<li><strong>Step 6: </strong>This crucial step entails assigning tasks to the team members based on their availability.</li>
<li><strong>Step 7:</strong> In this step, you assign the key milestones for your project, such as conducting meetings, getting project approvals, task starting points, mid-phase check-ins, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Step 8: </strong>Finally, you&#8217;ll need to work towards identifying the critical path.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Keep modifying your Gantt chart as the project plan changes. For this, you&#8217;ll need a tool that automatically updates task/event dependencies in real-time.</p>
<p><strong>Gantt Chart Tips to Keep in Mind</strong></p>
<p>In the final section, let&#8217;s run through a few tips to keep in mind to help you make the most out of your Gantt charts software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tip 1: Make the Gantt chart project planning process a collaborative effort.</strong> You need to ensure that your team is involved at every stage of decision-making and planning to keep everyone in the loop at all times.</li>
<li><strong>Tip 2: Make sure to customize the Gantt chart as per your team&#8217;s needs. </strong>For instance, you can use different colors for different team members when assigning tasks. The idea is to make the Gantt chart your own and see what works for you.</li>
<li><strong>Tip 3: Make sure to leverage the collaboration features. </strong>This includes attaching important files, notes, images, and so on. The goal is to make the plan relevant, updated, and easily accessible by one-and-all.</li>
<li><strong>Tip 4: Ensure that your team gets email alerts as the plan changes dynamically. </strong>Your team members should be alerted whenever a task gets completed or changed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>All in all, a Gantt chart is a project management tool that is intrinsically visual in nature. It empowers project managers to get a real-time overview of the project&#8217;s progress and status. This dynamic project management tool includes critical components of a project such as project tasks, duration, milestones, dependent tasks, and so on. Gantt charts online can be used by anyone who wishes to visualize their project planning process in a simple, in-depth, and meaningful manner.</p>
