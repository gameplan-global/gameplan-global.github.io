										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By Brad Egeland.</strong></p>
<p>Certain qualities across the board make the best leaders in many professions. In order to deliver consistent success in the project management world, our project leaders need to bring specific skills and characteristics to the table. Success on any given project can be luck, but success on a consistent basis on project engagements is far more than just luck – it&#8217;s what the project manager consistently brings to each project they are managing.</p>
<p>What I want to consider here are what characteristics make up the top performing project leaders based on my experience and the opinions of a few other trusted leaders. What sets them apart from less successful PMs?</p>
<p><strong>Excellent communicators</strong></p>
<p>Job One for the successful project manager is efficient and effective communication. The PM is the pipeline of project status for the entire project team – delivery side, customer side and all stakeholders. Failure in communication can lead to bad requirements, huge re-work, missed deadlines, poorly run meetings – it’s a recipe for project disaster. In my findings, it is the number one cause of project failures. In fact, <a href="http://www.bradegeland.com/past-survey-results.html">a survey that I personally conducted</a> with hundreds of project managers participating resulted in this feedback:</p>
<p><em>What do you consider to be the most important characteristic of a good Project Manager?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Good communicator &#8211; 52%</em></li>
<li><em>Experienced leader &#8211; 22%</em></li>
<li><em>Wise decision-maker &#8211; 12%</em></li>
<li><em>Organized professional &#8211; 11%</em></li>
<li><em>High integrity &#8211; 3%</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>From your experience, what is the primary cause of project failure?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Poor communication &#8211; 40%</em></li>
<li><em>Poor requirements/planning &#8211; 26%</em></li>
<li><em>Poor project leadership &#8211; 15%</em></li>
<li><em>Lack of senior management support &#8211; 11%</em></li>
<li><em>Untracked issues/risks &#8211; 6%</em></li>
<li><em>Poor governance and/or role definition &#8211; 2%</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As this survey clearly shows, communication is high on everyone’s list as a project success ingredient.</p>
<p><strong>Confident decision makers</strong></p>
<p>Project managers often must make quick decisions to keep project momentum moving forward. Projects delayed by outstanding key decisions can frustrate the project customer, delay deliverables and milestones, and lead to budget overruns and timeline issues. Sometimes the project manager needs to make important decisions that are critical to project progress with less information than they would like to have, but they must move forward with their best decision based on the information available to aid in the decision.</p>
<p><strong>Connected in the organization</strong></p>
<p>Based on my experience, being connected within your organization makes leading successful projects easier. I’m not saying you manipulate anything or anyone.  It’s about access to key people, key decision makers, and key information on a timely basis. You look at your projects and consider what connections are going to serve you, your team, your project, and your project client the best, and you work to make those connections happen. For me it’s always someone in accounting to get the best financial information for my project – good connections can make that happen effortlessly on a weekly basis. It’s also important to have good connections on the development leadership team when dealing with technical projects because you want to get the best technical resources available whenever possible. Preferential treatment happens to those who work for it. And never forget the old adage… &#8220;do unto others as you would have them do to you.&#8221; Be kind…be nice…be honest…but be strategic as well. And be selfish for your projects and project clients.</p>
<p><strong>Solid reputation</strong></p>
<p>If the project manager is to have collaboration, team member respect and accountability, and cooperation from all involved in the project, it is necessary to have a solid reputation, be above reproach and be of high integrity. I am able to tell any client, employer and team members that I can pass all background checks with flying colors. I have had dozens of background checks for critical projects, gaming projects, adoptions and youth leadership positions over the years. They can also search me far and wide on the internet and not find skeletons in my closet, which is important in order to gain partnerships, clients, and team member cooperation. If you are going to lead a customer’s $10 million project or his $50,000 project, he needs to know he can trust you as a proven leader of high integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Great negotiator</strong></p>
<p>In the project management world, PMs often have to negotiate dates, resources, changes, dollars and other items on projects with anyone from the customer to their own team members to members of their own executive management teams. Sometimes we’re negotiating and we don’t even realize it. We must be skilled negotiators who are always looking to better our position and project to successfully deliver on the project. Negotiation is just part of the game, but learn to be a better negotiator and you’ll be more successful at delivering solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Bottom line – the best project leaders have key connections and common leadership qualities that lead to project success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="Standard"><strong>by Brad Egeland.</strong></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">You’ve been handed a project for an important customer to your organization. Project managers are necessary – but also sometimes looked at by a project customer as an expensive, necessary (maybe) evil. So be careful – you may be treading on thin waters from the beginning. Figure out your place and how the customer perceives your role. Figure out what they want to see and hear from you each week. Usually, you can get that well defined during a project kickoff session but not always – and things can change along the way depending on how the project is proceeding… good or bad.</span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">For me, I’ve found several ways to help the project along in tight situations and increase customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><b>1. Save them money</b></span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">Every customer loves keeping some of their money. Big dollar projects often get charged out at high rates.  So look for ways to either stay well within budget or even charge fewer hours to the project. I led one large tech project for Texas Health and Human Services to implement a new software solution and they decided they weren’t a fan of project management charges. They considered the $150/hour charged by the professional services organization I was working for to be unnecessary. It wasn’t – it was necessary – but they were the customer, and they were a bit nervous about the budget. So I managed from afar and skipped a couple of onsite visits – saving them thousands of dollars overall. Suddenly, they decided they liked me and they went from nervous to feeling comfortable and satisfied. The project ended successfully, and we received more business from that government agency. It was a win-win.</span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="Standard"><b><span lang="EN-US">2. Communicate… well and often</span></b></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">The fastest way to create customer anxiety is to not communicate project status and issues fast enough or well enough. Nothing turns off a project client faster than feeling like they are being kept in the dark. The most important job for the project manager is effective and efficient communication… if you can’t do that with your project customer, your project team members, and all concerned stakeholders then you are in the wrong profession.</span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="Standard"><b><span lang="EN-US">3. Promote their business whenever possible</span></b></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">If you can run the customer’s project AND help promote their business in any way, then you are adding value to the project-client relationship, and that will always work in your favor in terms of customer satisfaction and retention. Maybe it’s a comment on their site/blog. Perhaps it’s running the project client’s information on your site/blog. Maybe it’s a press release about the project. Whatever you can do to add positive views about the client is a win.</span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="Standard"><b><span lang="EN-US">4. Be as transparent as possible</span></b></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">Always be as open and honest as possible. That doesn’t mean you need to bring everything troubling to them in the first five minutes. Review any issues that arise. Discuss with the project team and come up with one or more possible solutions &#8211; if possible &#8211; and then present them to the project client. Obviously, I’m not referring to a very long time span. The worst thing that can happen is for your client to find out there’s a problem from someone other than you – the project manager. If that happens, you might find yourself sitting across the desk from your CEO on the phone with your client working through the situation. Been there… done that… and it’s not fun. At least come up with some forward-thinking action to assess or attempt quickly and setup a meeting / call with your customer ASAP. You won’t be sorry, and they will be glad to help.</span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="Standard"><b><span lang="EN-US">5. Run great meetings</span></b></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">You’re going to have status meetings – likely at least weekly meetings – with your project client. Make them count and ensure that they are well attended by the key project resources on your project team and other stakeholders. First, prepare a status report and agenda. Ensure both are accurate and up to date. Distribute the information a day ahead of the meeting – if possible – to allow everyone to come prepared to participate and provide their status and feedback. Send out follow-up notes from the meeting quickly and ask for feedback and changes by noon the next day. Revise anything necessary and resend to all parties. The goal is to ensure that everyone on the project on both the project delivery side and the customer side are always on the same page. There needs to be a clear understanding throughout the engagement by everyone of their role and responsibilities and the overall project status – otherwise you could end up with re-work and budget overruns. Finally, if it seems like there is no need for a meeting – hold it anyway. Make it short and go around the room. Regularly cancelling meetings can cause people to perceive your meetings as less important, plus key information could fall through the cracks. Don’t cancel if at all possible.</span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US"> </span></p>
<p class="Standard"><span lang="EN-US">This list could go on. However, these are five key things that I’ve found I can do to make a project more successful, more profitable, and a customer more satisfied.</span></p>
