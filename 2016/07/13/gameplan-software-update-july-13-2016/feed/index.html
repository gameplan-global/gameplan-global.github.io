Let&#039;s also take this offline so we can discuss this, design it and validate the design.  Related to this, how important is costing of the equipment resources?  Costing in general?]]></description>

Yes, this would be a great feature.  It is already in our list and I&#039;ll increase its priority.]]></description>

Re. interactive Gantt - you can drag the Gantt chart bars now, which is a feature that many users are not aware of.  However, I expect you are looking for more than this.  Let&#039;s take this discussion offline and discuss the exact functionality that you&#039;d like in the Gantt.

Re. the scheduling algorithm, it&#039;s a proprietary algorithm which we have not publicly documented, however I am happy to explain how the algorithm works.  One significant difference to other scheduling products is that your resources (people) are always automatically levelled.  This means that a person can never be double-booked on two different tasks at the same time, even across different projects.  When there are multiple tasks available for a person to work on, they will be assigned to the highest priority task.  (In addition to the values in the drop-down list, priorities can be set using integer values from 1 to 1000).  Additionally, the scheduling algorithm always honours all other constraints that the user may enter, such as dependencies on other tasks or meetings, an earliest start date and whether the task can be worked on by a single person or if it needs everyone assigned to the task to work on it at one time.  One further rule is that tasks are always split around meetings.

There are further scheduling rules and constraints that we could add to the scheduling algorithm, however we are waiting for customer requests to determine which ones are important.]]></description>

We&#039;ll investigate this.  Given this is how all other Gantt chart tools work, it would be an intuitive way to do it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Resources - just like you add people, I would like the ability to add resources by drag and drop, and then the ability to list all resources used in a group. The reasoning being that when we work on site, we need to prepare all the resources that we will need when we get there. Likewise - as with my request for grouping teams, I would also like to group resources as &quot;kits&quot; so if I take my painting kit, it will have paint, brush, sandpaper, etc. If I group tasks into an &quot;on-site&quot; goup, then when I query &quot;show resources&quot; on the group, I will get a list of all the items that we need to take to a site...]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can you direct me to the algorithm that you use for setting timeline flow across projects? It&#039;s great, and it allows me to modify earliest start date, which is ok  - but maybe if I understood the nature of the algorithm I would know how to set myself up accordingly.

An interactive Gantt would be awesome - I prefer your method to TeamGantt, but I&#039;m still hoping that you will give me the functionality on the Gantt itself. I like the ability to change the information where I see it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Just a suggestion regarding cross-project predecessors and successors - it would be great if you could achieve the dependencies right in the Gantt by dragging a connecting line... it would be nice if the Gantt was more interactive directly...]]></description>
