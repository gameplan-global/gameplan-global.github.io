<p>Like a task, a milestone can be created in two ways:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>drag and drop onto the Whiteboard</li><li>double-click on the Whiteboard</li></ol>



<p>A milestone has a name, and, optionally, a due date.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204327379-milestone.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204327379-milestone.png"/></figure>



<p>A milestone report lists all of your milestones along with their date achieved or planned, their due date, and their current status.</p>



<p>Milestones are shown in two tables:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"><li>Completed</li><li>Remaining</li></ol>



<p>Completed milestones are milestones for which all of the upstream tasks and meetings that are linked to them are completed.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204327625-milestone_report.png"></p>



<p>For completed milestones, their status is determined by comparing the date that the milestone was achieved to the due date.&nbsp; The milestone due date was either met or missed.</p>



<p>For remaining milestones, their status is determined by comparing the plan date to the due date.&nbsp; The milestone plan date is the date when the milestone will be achieved if the project is carried out exactly on schedule for all tasks that affect the milestone and are not yet completed.&nbsp; If the report shows that a milestone plan date is later than the due date, the warning symbol will be shown and additional action over and above the current project plan must be taken if the milestone is to be achieved by the due date.</p>



<p>To associate a milestone with a task, create a link on the Whiteboard from the task to the milestone.</p>

<p>A milestone is used to mark an important progress point within a project.&nbsp; A milestone often marks a progress point within a project that must be reached by a certain date in order to keep the project on schedule.</p>



<p>A project can have many milestones.</p>



<p>Milestones can be used to segment a project into intervals to allow early indication of issues with the project schedule.</p>



<p>Milestones can provide a quick view into the tasks whose completion by certain dates is critical.&nbsp; The Milestones tab shows all milestones in one view and whether or not they are ahead of schedule or behind schedule.</p>



<p>Milestones have no impact on project duration<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milestone_%28project_management%29#cite_note-1"></a></sup>.<br>The properties of a Milestone are Name and Due date.</p>
