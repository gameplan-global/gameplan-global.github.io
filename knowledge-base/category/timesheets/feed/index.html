<p>Once your project is underway, it is important to track your project.&nbsp; Tracking your project ensures that your project schedule stays up to date.<br>When work on a task is performed, this work is either done on schedule, or it isn&#8217;t. &nbsp;(The work may be performed ahead of schedule or behind schedule).<br>If the work is done on schedule, you simply set the Percent complete for the task. &nbsp;The Percent complete field accepts integer values from 0 to 100. &nbsp;A 100% button exists to make it easy to set tasks fully completed.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-timesheet-data-panel-1.png" alt="GamePlan-timesheet-data-panel" title="Image: https://www.gameplan.global/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-timesheet-data-panel-1.png"/></figure>



<p>When a task is completed on schedule, the task status changes from Planned to Completed, the task fades on the Whiteboard, and the Gantt chart bar changes to show that work has been done on this task.&nbsp; The downstream schedule does not change because the task was completed on schedule.&nbsp; There were no delays, so nothing slides.<br>However, your tasks will not always be done on schedule.&nbsp; There are always unforeseen delays in any project.&nbsp; When work on a task is not done on schedule, you click the Edit Timesheet button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204369031-timesheet_section_in_data_panel2.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204369031-timesheet_section_in_data_panel2.png"/></figure>



<p>This brings up the Timesheet dialog and populates the timesheet with the scheduled work&nbsp;<strong>on the first day</strong>.&nbsp; In the image above, the Schedule pane shows that this task is scheduled to be worked on for 4 hours per day over two days.&nbsp; The timesheet only shows the schedule for the first day to make it easy to update your timesheet on a daily basis..</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204369022-timesheet.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204369022-timesheet.png"/></figure>



<p>There are 3 buttons to make adding data to the timesheet easier.<br><strong>Add new row</strong>&nbsp;creates a duplicate of the last row one day later.<br><strong>Add next scheduled work</strong>&nbsp;adds one row populated with the scheduled work for the next time period.<br><strong>Add all scheduled work</strong>&nbsp;adds all remaining scheduled work to the timesheet.</p>



<p>The last two buttons are inactive if they are not applicable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204369550-timesheet2.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204369550-timesheet2.png"/></figure>



<p>When a task is completely finished, it is important to specify this.&nbsp; This changes the status of the task from In Progress to Completed.&nbsp; We make this as easy as possible through a smart default value that changes based on the data in the timesheet.<br>To summarize, it is important to use timesheets to record the work done when tasks are not performed on schedule.&nbsp; This keeps the schedule valid and it also gives you a permanent record of the work carried out on the project.&nbsp; This is valuable data to capture.&nbsp; Analysing this data later is an important learning experience which leads to more accurate planning for future projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A mistake some people make is to use timesheets to control the plan.&nbsp; This is an incorrect use of timesheets. Timesheets should only be used to track the project by entering the actual work done on tasks.</p>

<p>Project tracking in GamePlan just got a whole lot easier!</p>



<p>For two reasons:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>you can enter % complete on your tasks</li><li>you can set a task to 100% complete even after timesheet data has been added</li></ul>



<p>When you double-click on a task, the dialog now shows a % complete field and a 100% button to easily set the task to 100% complete.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-percent-complete-dialog-0.png" alt="GamePlan-percent-complete-dialog-0" title="Image: https://www.gameplan.global/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-percent-complete-dialog-0.png"/></figure>



<p>Click the up or down arrow in the field or enter any integer value from 0 to 100. The Gantt chart will update to reflect the % complete, as shown below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-percent-complete-dialog.png" alt="GamePlan-percent-complete-dialog" title="Image: https://www.gameplan.global/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-percent-complete-dialog.png"/></figure>



<p>When you first enter a % complete value, the task status changes from Planned to In Progress. GamePlan also automatically creates the timesheet data that reflects the task being partially completed on schedule. This is important because it means you still have a permanent record of when the task was worked on.</p>



<p>If a task is partially completed, but it was started late so it is not on schedule, there are two ways to accurately track this.</p>



<p>The first is to press the Edit Timesheet button and enter the timesheet data for when the task was worked on. This functionality has always existed in GamePlan. The Edit Timesheet button is found in the Data Panel, as shown below, or on the pop-up dialog after the first timesheet data has been entered for a task.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-timesheet-data-panel-1.png" alt="GamePlan-timesheet-data-panel" title="Image: https://www.gameplan.global/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-timesheet-data-panel-1.png"/></figure>



<p>Note that after you enter a timesheet, GamePlan calculates the % complete from the entered timesheet data and you can no longer edit the % complete field. You can still set a task to 100% complete and the timesheet will update to reflect the remaining work on the task being completed on schedule.</p>



<p>The second way to set a task as partially complete if it starts late is to use the ‘When can it start?’ field and choose ‘After a date and time’. Then choose when the task started and enter the % complete. Timesheet data will be created to accurately reflect when the task actually started.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GamePlan-date-panel-earliest-start-date.png" alt="GamePlan-date-panel-earliest-start-date"/></figure>



<p>This same technique can be used if a task starts on schedule and then there is a delay. Enter the % complete that is done on schedule and then change the ‘When can it start?’ field, enter when the task re-starts after the delay, and then update the % complete. Timesheet data will be created to accurately reflect when the work was done.</p>



<p>This new functionality will make tracking a project in GamePlan much easier, while still creating timesheet data so that GamePlan maintains an accurate record of the time worked on the project.</p>
