<div>A meeting has a fixed start date and time.  Nothing will cause this start time to change.</div>

<div>Therefore, <b>if your activity must start at a given time, make it a meeting</b>.</div>
<div></div>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<div>A task has a flexible start time.  GamePlan will schedule the task to start as early as possible, while honouring all of the constraints that you put on the task.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6556" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/meeting.png" alt="" width="652" height="295"   sizes="(max-width: 652px) 100vw, 652px" /></div>
<p>The constraints that determine when a task can start are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a title="Link: http://support.gameplan.global/knowledgebase/articles/783645-how-do-i-set-the-start-date-for-a-plan" href="http://support.gameplan.global/knowledgebase/articles/783645-how-do-i-set-the-start-date-for-a-plan">plan start date</a></li>
<li>all links from other tasks and meetings</li>
<li>an earliest possible start date if one is specified</li>
<li>the availability of the people working on the task</li>
<li>the priority of the task relative to other tasks</li>
<li>the minimum and maximum number of people that can work on a task</li>
</ul>
<div>When the same person is assigned to a task and a meeting, the task will automatically split around the meeting.  This can be seen below in the Gantt chart.</div>
<div></div>
<div><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6557" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/meeting_splits_task.png" alt="" width="697" height="393"   sizes="(max-width: 697px) 100vw, 697px" /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Tasks cannot be changed to meetings and meetings cannot be changed to tasks, however tasks can be &#8220;locked&#8221;.  The schedule for a locked task will not change, even if there is a delay with a preceding task.</div>

<p>A client recently told us “once we commit resources to a task, the work schedule for that task cannot change, even if there are delays with preceding tasks.” The client asked to be able to “lock” a task in time so that, no matter what, the schedule for that task cannot change.</p>



<p>So this is exactly what we implemented. At the top of the Schedule panel there is now a Lock button. Press this button and the task is locked in time.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GamePlan_Locked_Tasks1b.jpg" alt="GamePlan_Locked_Tasks1b" title="Image: https://www.gameplan.global/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GamePlan_Locked_Tasks1b.jpg"/></figure>



<p>For clarity, locked tasks are shown with 3 lock icons. Also, the Lock button changes to an Unlock button.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GamePlan_Locked_Tasks2.jpg" alt="GamePlan_Locked_Tasks2" title="Image: https://www.gameplan.global/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GamePlan_Locked_Tasks2.jpg"/></figure>



<p>We also implemented the ability to manually adjust the schedule for a locked task. Below the task name is an Edit button (shown above). Pressing the Edit button displays a dialog that allows you to manually edit the schedule for the locked task. The people assigned to the task, as well as the work start and end time can be changed.</p>

<p>One of the properties on a task is Priority. &nbsp;The default task priority is Medium.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204325201-task_priority.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204325201-task_priority.png"/></figure>



<p>When there is more than one task available for a person to work on, this person will be scheduled on the available task with the highest priority.</p>



<p>As well as the five priorities in the drop-down list, integer values between 1 and 1000 can be entered. &nbsp;The higher the number, the higher the priority. &nbsp;If you use both numeric and text priorities in the same plan, here is how they are related:</p>



<p>900 &#8211; Very High<br>700 &#8211; High<br>500 &#8211; Medium<br>300 &#8211; Low<br>100 &#8211; Very Low</p>



<p>The following example shows three tasks that are all available for the same person to work on. &nbsp;The high priority task is scheduled first, followed by the 500 priority task and then the low priority task.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-120679654-GamePlan%20Priority%20Example%201.png"></p>



<p>It is important to consider priorities when using the Maximum hours/day field. &nbsp;The Maximum hours/day field is used when a person plans to work on multiple tasks in a single day rather than working on one task at a time until completion. &nbsp;Higher priority tasks will be scheduled earlier in the day than the lower priority tasks.</p>

<p>This is intuitive, however, once you create a number of tasks this way, even something as simple as drag and drop gets tedious.</p>



<p>There is a more efficient way to create tasks:&nbsp;<strong>double-click any empty space on the Whiteboard</strong>&nbsp;(not on an existing task) and the following dialog will be displayed:</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204324982-task_creation_dialog.png"></p>



<p>This allows you to create a task, a milestone or a group at the exact position on the Whiteboard where you double-clicked, which is faster than drag and drop.</p>
