<p>When more than one person is assigned to a task, a second field appears in the task properties under&nbsp;<strong>When can it start?<br></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204328543-task_multiple_people_data_panel.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204328543-task_multiple_people_data_panel.png"/></figure>



<p>There are three possible values for this field.&nbsp; The default value is&nbsp;<strong>When anyone is available</strong>.&nbsp; This means that the task can start when any of the people assigned to the task are available to work on it.</p>



<p>The second value for this field is&nbsp;<strong>When all people are available</strong>.&nbsp; This means that the task can only start when all of the people assigned to the task are available.<br>The third value for this field is&nbsp;<strong>When some people are available.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This lets you specify two additional rules:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>the minimum number of people that must be available for the task to be worked on (default = 1)</li><li>the maximum number of people that can work on the task at one time (default = unlimited)</li></ul>



<p>Setting the maximum number of people allows you to assign all the people to a task who can potentially work on the task, while specifying that only one person at a time can work on the task.</p>

<p>Yes, any number of people can work on a task.</p>



<p>To assign multiple people to a task, drag and drop each person separately onto the task.&nbsp; Alternatively, assign multiple people to a task with a single drag and drop by pressing the Control key on a PC or the Command key on a Mac as you select the people.&nbsp; The people will remain selected so they can be assigned to another task without having to re-select them.</p>



<p>You will see each person&#8217;s image to the left of task, as shown below.</p>

<p>When a task is selected, the Data Panel also shows the people who are working on the task.</p>

<p>To remove a person from a task, in the Data panel, press the red delete icon to the right of the person that you want to remove.</p>

<p>You can change a person&#8217;s working hours from the default 40 hour work week.</p>



<p>To change the working hours, first select the person in the Icons panel.</p>



<p>The Data panel then displays information for the selected person.&nbsp; The default value for Working hours is 8:00 am &#8211; 4:00 pm, Monday to Friday.</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can double-click the person in the Icons panel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204330118-person.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204330118-person.png"/></figure>



<p>Click in the Working hours field and choose the person&#8217;s individual working hours at the bottom of the list.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204330151-person2.png"></p>



<p>Change the working hours by clicking the Set working hours button, immediately below the Working hours field.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-204330214-person3.png" alt="" title="Image: kb-204330214-person3.png"/></figure>



<p>In the Working Hours dialog you &#8220;paint&#8221; the cells which represent your working hours. &nbsp;The working hours are shown with the green cells. &nbsp;The example below shows working hours of 8 am to 12 pm and 1 pm to 5 pm on Monday, Wednesday and Friday of each week.</p>



<p><img decoding="async" src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kb-192888754-GamePlan_working_hours5_small.png"></p>



<p>When you change a person&#8217;s working hours,&nbsp;you will immediately see the effect on the schedule. &nbsp;If you reduce their working hours in a week, tasks that they are assigned to will take longer to finish.</p>



<p>If you change the number of working hours in a day from the default of 8 hours, and you want this to be reflected when you enter time in days (or weeks or months) you change this in&nbsp; Settings.</p>
